* took a look at <code>functools</code>. nothing i can use at the moment.  
* read:
  > Subset selection of high-depth next generation sequencing reads for de novo genome assembly using MapReduce framework
  at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4682372/
  notes: not enough infor on the trimming alg and results (there's the name of the program used by the way), i think this could make a big change in the results of using a subset of data or not, especially cause i don't think i have ever kept in my trimming program read with such a low minimum quality score as described in the article. the other thing is that for large genomes they are using allpaths, and so not just paired end reads, but also mate pair. looks like they are just making the subset selection on the paired reads, so i'd like to know the effect using velvet, for example, and just pe.

* TO DO LIST:
  * ~~comment the style for all the plots, to eliminate background colors.~~
  * ~~for the first plot in the **new** folder, fix the layout of the scale for both axis to make it consistent with other figures.~~
  * ~~save all the plot with high definition adding these lines when saving:~~
    ```python
    fig.patch.set_alpha(0.5)
    plot.savefig(namefig,dpi=100,bbox_inches='tight')
    plot.savefig(namefig+'.svg',bbox_inches='tight')
    ```
  * ~~for all the last plots with the comparisons between all the simulations do the same and set max values for the x axis as in carlos' mail~~
  * ~~remove 'Eff' from title~~ (8/1/2016, also removed 'TE')
  * ~~for the TE plots decrease the bin number so that the figures are less messy~~
  * ~~eliminate legend from 4.7 to 4.10~~ (8/1/2015 actually positioning it inside the plot and substituting alpha channel, usig marker instead of lines to be more compact)

  * all done on <code>comparison_plot.py</code> and <code>comparison_plot_derivatives.py</code> and launched.

#####8/1/2016

* moved **CDATAV.p** from **old_images** to main **new** folder to get images again with yesterday changes.

* re launched last two because i forgot to change the launch files and i moved tthe scripts to **scripts** repository.

* fixed images for paper. (note on matplotlib, to use marker instead of line in a scatterplot just use legend, but to have just one point instead of 3, need to use <code>scatterpoints=1</code>

#####11/1/2016

* launche 10 more runs for the first model simulation to save an average curve of the fitness, that is probably going to be requested for the paper. (will take this week probably)

* in the meanwhile went back to the code without classes cause it appears to be more effiv=cient (anyway i was probably saving more stuff in the classes one, that we don't need). there's one problem to fix here cause it's hanging (after finish anyway), could be the <code>os.fork</code> or the function jumps. if the second one it should work tomorrow just changing the seed.

* to address the possibility that it's the first one i looked through the doc for <code>multiprocessing</code> module in Python. not so simple cause i have to pass multiple varibales all different in the processes and i'd want them to run all toghether. for now i'm not satisfied wit the solution i tried.

* will need to talk about the results of the model. maybe also try to use a loooooot of jumps to make a coparison and see if the fitness stay below 1 (now it's almost always reaching 1).

* interesting: from the model it is seen that the ratio between targets that can be targeted in the pathogen and the ones actually present in the host converge after some evolutionary time, meaning that the host is actually becoming adapted.
* to do: semilog plot for some of the images already created on the y axis.

#####12/1/2016

* the problem was that the code was hanging cause it took tooooo much time to create a suitable pathogen for the host (i.e. with r>.5). the possible solutions to this were:
  * changing the treshold value to a lower one, starting with a pathogen that is less fit, like it just jumped from a different host.
  * create an initial pathogen in a not complitely random way, being able to create it with r>.5 much faster.
  At the moment we are using the first solution with <code>r>.1</code>, and launching 10 processes at a time.

* modified c's notebook to have a python code running on the server to obtain the plot.

* launche the simulation for:
  * DT1000
  * DT5000
  * DT10000
  * DT20000
  All of these had <code>r>.1</code>, <code>MU1=1.0/3</code> and <code>MU2=2.0/3</code>.

* we also need to address (^ time gap between host jumps), the role of the parameter, so I'm rnning other simulations changing NTO (maximum number of gene targeted by an effector) (values 10, 5, 3), MU1 and MU2. MU1 and MU2 are used in the random choice of having the gain of a link (number<mu1), nothing, or removal of a link (number>mu2). I'm changing this value simmetrically (at the moment), after added some coefficient eta and beta: beta is going to be 3-eta (mu2 resulting has to be <=1, so beta has to be between 1 and 3 to have a right increase), and i'm changing eta from 1 to 0.5 to 0.1.
  I'm now addressing the possible combination of these parameters for DT=1000. All the results (and images when ready) are stored in the cluster in the **results_second_model/** folder, inside subfolders, each of contains a meta file with all the parameters used in the simulation.

* changed NEO=3 insted of 5 to avoid probability problem during the caclulation. Rerunning everything

* beta=1.5-eta and not 3 cause it went over 1.0. Anyway this way is not simmetrical, but the opposite (tell c tomorrow).

#####13/1/2016

* finished running what wrote yesterday, plus all the plots and additional DT (with already exaplined changes in NTO and MUs) 500, 5000 and 10000.

* observations: from yesterday runs it looks like, as it may be obvious, that at the beginning of the simulation if a strain has a very high r value (close to 1), and there is a jump, this results (almost always) in a huge decrease of the fitness. On the opposite if the jump happen at the end of the simulation for a strain with an equally high r value, this usually results in a more mild decrease in the fitness. I thought this is due to the fact that at the beginning of the simulation the number of genes is limited and an high r is due mainly to high specificity towards the target gene present in the host, while at the end all the strain tend to have higher r, probably due to an increase in the total number of effector genes. This was confirmed looking at the plots for the number of genes.

* other minor observations to check: after running the simulation for DT500 and others it looks that maybe the NTO and MU parameters have a more visible effect for low DT (this can be the case cause the strains have not enought itme to reach a good fitness before the jump happens). In particoular it looks like the slope to reach an average high fitness is decreasing when the mutation probability is >> than the probability to gain targets (or lose them).  
  Another observation is that at the end of the simulation less strains arise in the same DT (i see this comparing the new strains per jump), this is probably due to the implementation itself (as we thought it would have made sense like this), cause if a pathogen is already fixed the probability to mutate is lower AND we are just introducing new strands if they have a better r compared to the mother strain.

* to do next days: switch from this r calculation function to the other one (<code>g_p_mapa2</code>) as this one is linear, and the other one is semi linear (Hill function, will have to pass 1 as parameter so), so the r increase over the evolutionary time should be slower. (the same -more or less- could be obtained multiplying the present function for a factor that makes the result smaller)

* example plots for what i was explaining:

#####14/1/2016

* running the version with the hill function to calculate the fitness (at the moment I'm just doing DT=1000 to see the differences)

* trying to fix the branches problem, I think it is due to <code>deepcopy()</code> function not bing used anymore (???). Testing now for results.

* note: the verison of <code>hpmodel2_2.py</code> that uses the Hill function it's still running, being cosiderabely slower than the linear version (this is probably due to the fact the the linear function breaks at !, while this one never reaches 1 by definition, but is just asymptotic).

#####15/1/2016

* still looking at the branches problem, adding some <code>assert</code> to check if i can find when the duplication is happening

* FINALLY found the bug and fixed it (it was due to something very stupid, ie if the strain with the max id died in a jump is not going to be in the set of alive strains retained in the next jump and so the methid we were using to determine the id of the strain was a mess because it was based on the max id found in the cictionary at that time. we just needed to move this line outside of the for loop. (anyway the very very good news is that because the branch are due to this all the plots without branches, ie 95% are fine and we do not need to re make them).

* todo:
  * small table with average r after jumps for a serie of different parameters
  * semilog pot for old simulation
  * ~~figures for old simulation with the average fitness~~

#####18/1/2016

* created script in <code>scripts/plotting/</code> to generate plots for the first model simulation (DT5000, DT10000 and DT20000) with the average fitness over the simulation. (note: there's nothing interesting i can see here)
DT5000:

* studying nodejs and plot streaming from sensor

#####19/1/2016

* i clearly made a mess with yesterday plots, so fixing it (i have the plot the whole time not an average over eah jump!!!)

* fixed it. Now the plots make sense. These are the plot for DT5000 for increasing values of c (the mutation rate).
  ![DT5000 c=0.1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qvq45r8wj99zf76/average_fitness_n0_5000.png?dl=1)
  ![DT5000 c=0.2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vorpd8my4wyav4s/average_fitness_n1_5000.png?dl=1)
  ![DT5000 c=0.3](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ckyhkht3gvunmgo/average_fitness_n2_5000.png?dl=1)
  ![DT5000 c=0.4](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qqzserlap2ly812/average_fitness_n3_5000.png?dl=1)
  ![DT5000 c=0.5](https://www.dropbox.com/s/guzgtfbdpdo878v/average_fitness_n4_5000.png?dl=1)
  ![DT5000 c=0.6](https://www.dropbox.com/s/enfxhzjetvj8blo/average_fitness_n5_5000.png?dl=1)
  i![DT5000 c=0.7](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xme5hiovndetrlz/average_fitness_n6_5000.png?dl=1)
  ![DT5000 c=0.8](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vupl7qhalolop9c/average_fitness_n7_5000.png?dl=1)
  ![DT5000 c=0.9](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d1246k08evv55at/average_fitness_n8_5000.png?dl=1)
  Here we can see an increase in the fitness during the simulation, ad more interesting (even if kind of obvious, but means that the simulation itself makes sense) there's a decrease in this value when there is a jump (see below the different pattern for DT10000 and DT20000 for the c value 0.5), and then it increase again.
  Moreover we can see the effect of the c value than increasing change the slope of the curve (it happens the same for DT10000 and DT20000, but I'm not posting here all the plots).
  DT10000 c=0.5:
  ![average fitness DT10000 c=0.5](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2vhmchmpecod9iu/average_fitness_n4_10000.png?dl=1)
  DT20000 c=0.5:
  ![average fitness DT20000 c=0.5](https://www.dropbox.com/s/50bgsfdqvsp8pvi/average_fitness_n4_20000.png?dl=1)

* the images are weird because the actual fitness, is 1-the value considered (moreover, as easily seen, there was a typo in the average function, cause the max value is 1. I plotted them again with 1-value and fixing the scale. I also plotted a typical run, and not just the average.
  The curve is good (meaning is what expected, cause after the jump there is a decrease in fitness, thean then increase until the next jump), but as it can be see in the next images, the overall fitness stays quite low.
  We so tried to run the simulation again for DT100 (new), DT20000 and no jumps, but changing the recombination rate by 100x. This results in the following changes in fitness.
  Typical run fitness for DT20000 and c=0.1:
  ![DT20000 c=0.1 typical run fitness](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k2rgcxl1euomzpm/one_fitness_n0_20000.png?dl=1)
  c=0.5:
  ![DT20000 c=0.5 typical run fitness](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yzol703yfx8m65u/one_fitness_n4_20000.png?dl=1)
  c=0.9:
  ![DT20000 c=0.9 typical run fitness](https://www.dropbox.com/s/27brhyeh69bixju/one_fitness_n8_20000.png?dl=1)
  Average fitness for DT20000 and c=0.1:
  ![DT20000 c=0.1 average fitness](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2xhrb24hi8yxxwq/average_fitness_n0_20000.png?dl=1)
  c=0.5:
  ![DT20000 c=0.5 average fitness](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kajxjf5ks0zp8n0/average_fitness_n4_20000%20%281%29.png?dl=1)
  c=0.9:
  ![DT20000 c=0.9 average fitness](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5x9ip3dlu38ph59/average_fitness_n8_20000.png?dl=1)

  For no jumps this is one run:
  ![no jumps one run fitness](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mgthdwqk3eoiima/one_fitness_n0_nojumps.png?dl=1)
  And this is the average:
  ![no jumps average fitness](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ei8etgtycaowbne/average_fitness_n0_nojumps.png?dl=1)
  These are oviously not very good beacuse this does not reflect a real situation, anyway this result is given by the model tself, tat is not considering host, and has max tresholds for number of TEs and Eff and lengths. This is the reason we try to see what happen changing the recombination rate (see below, better), and the reason this model had to be made better by the second model, that considers more and more parameters (more realistic).
  Other note is that the "strange" situation seen at the beginning of all the plots is due to an unstable state at the beginning of the simulation, should not be considered as a result.

  Increased the recombination rate. Rerun everything overnight with more runs (20 for DT100 and DT2000, 100 for no jumps). Will have results tomorrow.

#####20/1/2015

* the simulation finished overnight. run the scripts for the fitness plots.

* here the results for high recombination rate and nojumps:
  over one single run:
  ![high rec rate no jumps, one run fitness](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x9x199xp3epgxp4/one_fitness_n0_highmutation_nojumps.png?dl=1)
  averaged over 100 runs:
  ![high rec rate, no jumps, average fitness](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n8qeq1vq5zvf9q2/average_fitness_n0_highmuation_nojumps.png?dl=1)
  Because these run are complitely new (note that with this rec rate we have A LOT of extinctions, that's why the simulation is so fast compaed to the previous we had done), I also run the <code>clusterV.py</code> script to get the other figures.

* adding inset to the plots for high recombination rate and DT100 (this means 2000 jumps, so they're very noisy). This snippet of matplotlib will make the trick:
  ```python
  if c_value=='n0/':
        ax_inset=fig1.add_axes([0.5,0.5,0.3,0.3])
    else:
        ax_inset=fig1.add_axes([0.5,0.1,0.3,0.3])
    ax_inset.xaxis.set_major_formatter(mtick.ScalarFormatter(useMathText=True))
    plt.ticklabel_format(style='sci', scilimits=(0,0))
    ax_inset.yaxis.set_major_formatter(mtick.ScalarFormatter(useMathText=True))
    plt.ticklabel_format(style='sci', scilimits=(0,0))
    ax_inset.plot(range(100000,101000),plot_this[100000:101000],"k")
  ```

*

* TO DO LIST: 
  * ~~fix all the position for the inset plots~~
  * change c's <code>clusterV.py</code> to plot averages with extinctions between two jumps and ~~add colors to randomwalk~~
  * use it to plot all the <code>high_mutation*</code> simulations
  * ~~get 40 more runs for DT100 high mutation rate to get better plots~~[running]

#####21/1/2016

* simulation finished overnught. running script (both clusterV.py and fitness ones) to get the new plots (it takes a crazy amount of time).

* in the meanwhile studying javascript and bash

* notes about bash:
  <code>sed</code> looks for a substring in files
  
  notes on modyfing <code>~/.bash_profile</code>: here i can define all the aliases i need. to start using the changes in the current session without starting a new temrinal i have to type:
  ```bash
  source ~/.bash_profile
  ```
  i can also define here variables (convention uppercase), remember that as i used them in makefile they are always precedeed (does this exist?) by <code>$</code>. Remeber to write <code>export</code> to use a variable in all child processes.
  <code>PS1</code> is a varibale that defines the markup and style of the command prompt
  VERY IMPORTANT the <code>$PATH</code> environment variable stores a list of directories separated by colons, that are the directories that contain scripts (so here is were are the script and stuff you can launch from command line in any directory, when install something new in strange location, i can add the path to this variable to make it works fine).
  the command <env> returns a list of environment variables.

* SLURM training [add notes here]

* observation: the average fitness in the simulation for DT100 and high recombination is increasing, but i can't see this pattern in any of the runs i plotted as single run. so i'm quite sure the curve is due to the fact that the runs that result in extinctions were not fit at all at the beginning and are pushing the average down (while I'm not considering them anymore at the end cause they are ded).

#####22/1/2016

* still plotting with all the changes needed for publication suitable images.  
  note: probably so slow cause the resource on this server are now limited as they are migrating to the other one.
  Added colors to the randomwalk plot for high recombination rate and DT=100.
  Added inset for average plots of the same simulation in position that don't overlap with the main plot (very noisy, zooming in 1000 evolutionary events, ie 10 jumps).

* studying html and CSS in the meanwhile.
  So the CSS stylesheet are always in this form:
  ```css
  p {
	color: blue;
	font-family: Vivaldi, cursive; /*this will apply the first available in the user computer*/
  }
  ```
  Also, remember, when setting <code>width</code> or <code>height</code>, that px has to be just after the value, without any space.
  To have roound borders, i need to set the property <code>border-radius</code> to npx.
  I can also put mutiple selctors on the same line if i want to style just the lement that are nested (for example header in div will be <code>div h3 {}</code>.Because of the cascading behaviour the more specific the instruction the higher their priority. To make sure to grab just the element that are _directly_ nestedi need to write <code>parent_selector > child_selector { /*some code here*/}</code>.
  The special selector <code>*</code> apply the style to the whole page (basically it works as in bash).
  special selector are <code>class</code> and <code>id</code>. in CSS they are identified by <code>.class</code> or <code>#id</code>.
  Remember that there are also <code>pseudo-class_selectors</code>, for example i caould use <code>a:hover</code>to change how a links looks like when you pass the cursor over it (other useful are a:link, a:visited, selector:first-child, selectro:nth-child(number)).
  The <code>display</code> property can take the following values (from [codeacademy](http://www.codecademy.com) ):
  > *block*: This makes the element a block box. It won't let anything sit next to it on the page! It takes up the full width.
  >*inline-block*: This makes the element a block box, but will allow other elements to sit next to it on the same line.
  >*inline*: This makes the element sit on the same line as another element, but without formatting it like a block. It only takes up as much width as it needs (not the whole line).
  >*none*: This makes the element and its content disappear from the page entirely!
  The <code>float</code> property is useful not to have elements overlapping each others.
  The property <code>clear</code> will position the element below the last one on the right, left or both, as specified.

* working on fixing c's <code>clusterV.py</code> to make it works with exctinctions between jumps. (so far i hae the plot for a single run -one that survives for all the evolutionary events considered-, but i still need the averages).

* I'm launching a trial of clusterV.py on 5 runs to check if it fails somewhere (since it's taking a lifetime). Remember to change back the name of the output!!
   UPDATE: fixed it (not in a very elegant way, but it works fine), i just added <code>try ... except</code> syntax to avoid the cases with exctinctions. I'm now running the code on all 100 runs data (I'll probably have it on monday?). I also commented all the <code>print</code> cause the mails i was getting were too heavy.

#####25/1/2016

* <code>clusterV.py</code> is still running (O.O).

* looked generally at the paper draft, discussed some results.

* plotting lengths and number of units over time for different c values in semilog and loglog scale to see if there's something more visible than in the "normal" ones.

* created a github project to put all the codes in and started working on its website:
  TODO Website:
  (installed gem-github and jeckyll to work locally)
  * add an image as header background --> change color of text accordingly both in header and body (titles and links)
  * check on a bigger computer the heigth of the header, decrease it if needed
  * make the two buttons i just created fixed on the left, change their links when the project is ready
  * make the body part float on the right accordingly
  * add the id navigator in the stylesheet
  * change the footer to tell who is mantaining the project (add link to github profiles/team), that the main theme was modified, add a contact email

  TODO Project:
  * add all the script in a ordered fashion
  * add argparse to all the script, and instructions in the README
  * add folder with important images/images to be displayed in the website
