##Lab journal  
####_Alice Minotto_

#####29 and 30/09/2015

* downloaded Anaconda (already with the numpy library).
* updated Ipython (use the command _jupyter notebook &_ to open the tab)
* set up a git[hub] account and read about how to use it

* took a look at Carlos' scripts and tried them in the notebook to get plots.  
 **need to use the line _% matplotlib inline_ somewhere at the beginning of the script to make pictures display in the browser**

#####1/10/2015

* read markdown tutorial and began the journal lab (i hope)   
* lab journal is now online in my github account (remember that i had to change the file name adding *.md to make it be displayed in the right way)  
 _notes for myself to remember: it looks like I have to committ deleted files too unless i want to pull and merge each time, plus this way should prevent me to dlete it manually online_
