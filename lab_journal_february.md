#####1 and 2/2/2016

* corrected firmula in <code>mutation()</code> in the new model (also updated the code in github)

* launched again simulations for DT10000 NTO=5 an NTO=10 with the right formula (should be the same anyway). REMEMBER that in the server i made a mistake and the folder named nto10 is actually NTO=5 and viceversa (the zip file are ok instead).

* PREVIOUSLY forgot to note here:
  * from github created webpage for the project. The branch for the webpage is <code>gh-pages</code>
  * quite heavily modified the theme: changed header background, color theme, add navigation bar on the left that moves up in small screens, changed footer, add contacts, add horizontal ruler between sections, add images in the section and instructions to use the codes (with links). also created a nice preview for the website in social network changing the <code>head</code> part.
  * all this is now in the temporary <code>contents</code> branch, need to be merged as soon as carlos look at it and says is fine
  * to change the html file without committing it all the times i need to use **Jeckill** (installed it, it needs ruby -already on mac-, and rubygems for github, easily found instructions on github).
    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

* galaxy training -see other file-

* NOTE: i can use this [link](http://htmlpreview.github.io) to see a preview of the page in a branch.

#####meanwhile

* fork Dan's github repository for the training webpage of the lab, copy-pasted content from the previous website.
  Added <code>.html</code> files for the buttons in the navigation bar.
  added links in the navbar and make the right tab active at a given time.
  Added a CSS file to define <hr/> to use to divide sections and footer in the website.

* changed the README file in a branche for the genome size evolution project so that it doesn't say anymore that nothing is working, as i really hope is not true anymore.

#####10 and 11/2/2016

* wrote a file using the <code>csv</code> python module to order the data from the second model simulations in a huge csv file like following:  
  DT,NTO,ETA,RUN,JUMP,STRAIN,EFFECTOR,TARGET,SCORE,FITNESS,FIRST_APP,TIME,SIZE
  The code name is <code>tidy_table_second_model.py</code> and it is in scripts.

* the table is getting to big (more than 150GB for the first simulation)==> gave up on this.

#####12/2/2016

* worked w/ c on the manuscript, it has to be shorter. correct some typos, add tables, delete some sentences and add some comments.

#####15/2/2016

* working on modifying the population dynamics images. instead of one plot with all the jumps for each DT I should get one plot made of four subplots: the first one will dysplay just the first jump, the second one the first two jumps, than the first five jumps and all the twenty jumps. The plots will have to share the y axis to save space and have a common title.

* created 4 subplots and plotted the right number of jumps in a loop.
added black stem with:
  ```python
markerline, stemlines, baseline=subp.stem(ts,Rs,linefmt='--', markerfmt='.', basefmt='',stemlineswidth=0.1)
        plot.setp(stemlines, 'linewidth', 1, 'color', 'k')
```
  To save space i used <code>plot.tight_layout()</code>.
  To share the y axis i added <code>sharey=ax1</code> whe naming the subplot, to hide the y axis in the second column:
  ```python
  if subp==ax2 or subp==ax4:
            plot.setp(subp.get_yticklabels(), visible=False)
```

#####16/2/2016

* going on with the figures. I have to hide the offset in the second column.
  After tryng lot of options that didn't work, the best solution in this case was to get rid of <code>sharey=ax1</code> because it will be shared anyway as I'm setting the <code>ylim</code>, then adding the following line to the previous code:
  ```python
if subp==ax2 or subp==ax4:
            plot.setp(subp.get_yticklabels(), visible=False)
            subp.yaxis.set_major_formatter(mtick.FormatStrFormatter('%.0f'))
```
  I also made the line thicker for visualization purposes.

* i could also fix these: increase the font-size of the labels as they are very small and i don't think you can read them on paper. Add the x axis and y axis label.

* fixed the label size. I think not to put labels because they are going to be repeated and to take space, so it would probably be better put a note in the description. (anyway the population dynamics is probably not going to the paper after all??).
  These would be the new plots:

#####17/2/2016

* goign o w/ the tsltraining website: added folder with the badges pages and the needed pages.

* TO IMPROVE: ~~Add in css a style for the anchor (actually just change the position of <code></a></code>~~, as i don't want them to show as link. The category finder in the main page is empty. no badges found for molecular biology nor sterile practice. ~~also it would be nice to relocate all the badges images in the website itself~~.

* added an additional navigation bar in the footer with styling

#####18/2/2016

* added a contact form with formspree.io, added a twitter follow button  
  i used formspree instead of PHP cause github pages are static and do not allow the use of PHP (there are a lot of tutorial to create a PHP contact form but it woouldn't work).

* note that bootstrap column are nested (so in my case i have a div that span 7 col, the div inside it still go up to a sum of 12)

* deleted the twitter button cause the account is not active anymore (the code is still there commented)

* try to add the TSL logo in the top navbar before the button but it looks very ugly to me (the code is till there commented)

* added a thank you page for when you submit a form

#####22/2/2015

* launched new carlos' version of <code>clusterV.py</code> for the derivateves and changed the plotting script accordingly (it is just a trial in <code>change_DT_Qi/</code> folder at the moment) over the weekend.
  Still miss the results for the case without jumps cause the hpc node died.

* switching to slurm cluster. After *several* crazy errors I finally have one <code>submit.sh</code> script and a <code>command.sh</code> script. The first one contains the list of resources needed, while the second one is actually launching the script with <code>srun</code>.
  Here's the final version. *submit.sh*:  
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p normal
#SBATCH -N 1
#SBATCH -n 1
#SBATCH --mem 32768
#SBATCH -t 0-5:00
#SBATCH -o slurm.%N.%j.out
#SBATCH -e slurm.%N.%j.err
#SBATCH --mail-type=END,FAIL
#SBATCH --mail-user=alice.minotto@tsl.ac.uk

srun $@
```
  The *command.sh* script:
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/tsl/software/testing/gsl/1.16/x86_64/bin/lib; \
source python-2.7.4; \
python /usr/users/TSL_20/minottoa/change_DT_Qi/clusterV.py /usr/users/TSL_20/minottoa/new/ 50 10
```
  To run it i need to do  
  ```bash
sbatch submit.sh command.sh
```
  This way i can just change the second part reusing the first one as many times as i want.

* so i'm finally running the new version of clusterV on the <code>new</code> folder.

* IMPORTANT: both the <code>*.sh</code> scripts need to be executable. change <code>chmod 755</code>.

* uploaded in github the files with data for the first model

* TODO: 
  * tell about these files in the webpage
  * ~~deleted by mistake <code> import multiprocessing etcetc</code> in mprostest.py in github, need to add this~~

* launched a trial to see if i an plot the derivatives (remember that the time will be -1). launched the simulation for 1 run of the first model DT5000 to save a list of the events occurring.

* the derivatives plot are very confused due to the large fluctuations

#####23/2/2016

* slurm killed my simulation with events due to overtime. launched again after changed the timeout in the submit.sh script.
  Also i just got a problem [OS error 13] because i do not have permission to create a folder. This is very weird since i've already used the script before, ayway i <code>chmod 777</code> the folder where i want the result.

* plotting some of the figures for the paper with an inset.

* *NOTHING* is working today:
  * the job to get events from the first model simulation that died is still pending
  * the last version to plot the len distribution of te is not saved (??????? this is incredibly weird since i always modified the same file, anyway i need to retrieve all the options that i used previously)
  * c sent me a notebook to plot the derivatives, BUT:
    * jupyter is not working anymore on the laptop, neither i'm able to reinstall it, despite actually having what needed (broken after the pc died????)
    * found out that the last simulation (the one for no jumps) probably died with the all cluster so CDATAV is incomplete and i will need to run <code>clusterV.py</code> again, but no resources in the cluster
    * the files are very heavy and can't be managed easily on a personal computer
    * (i knew this but i forgot) there's no matplotlib on the laptop

#####24/2/2016

* went to SLURM workshop anf figured out important things:
  >TSL
  >the time limit for the available queues is:
  >2h for development
  >6h for short
  >7d for medium
  >-- for long and interactive (but we are asked to exit from the last one when we don't need it anymore)
  >
  >IF you put a time requirement in your bash script you don't need to choose a queue, and it is actually better as your job will have higher priority (because if you don't the system will suppose that you need the max time for the queue).
  >IF you exceed the time limit your job will be KILLED.
  >Same if you exceed the memory limit. If you don't specify a memory limit the default is 4G (2G for interactive).
  >
  >If you want to set the queue from the bash script (you can do it from command line anyway) you will need to type:
  >```unset SBATCH_PARTITION```
  >(this will be valid for the present session, if you always need it, put it in <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.bashprofile</code>).
  Moreover the queues are not actually separeted (not even by institutes).

* I relaunche both the code to get the figures for the paper with a very low time limit (now it's not pending despite the memory requirement), and the simulation for the events (that just started running).

* i finally have the distribution plots with the following modifications: the "bad plot" is in an inset, with axes with ticks and tick labels. The inset is transparent and so the legend. The legend has just 5 cases for Eff. I added 20% on the y axis to allow more space for legend and inset. I added marker to the legend. set y lim both to inset and mai plot, starting at 0.

#####25/2/2016

* remade the plot for length distribution of effectors for DT5000 because i forgot to change the legend step.

* the simulation for the events died overnight (there were no pickle imported in the main script). moved the saving in pdt.py, i also think it will be better to have more smaller files instead of a huge one.
  Launche again both for DT5000 and 10000 (no more because i think it's doing something weird with the location of the output files and i want to check before risking to overwrite stuff.

* also yesterday got rid of contact form in TSL trianing website and put email and link to TSL website instead.

* changed c notebook to get derivatives (pending obviously).

* [This](https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/squeue.html) may be useful to use SLURM

* software node is active, the warning was there by mistake. it can be accessed just like for hpc.

* fixed a mistake in c der notebook (concatenating string and llst on line 76) and add some print as a debigging tool. (it failed). launche again with the modifications. updated in github repo.

* simulation for DT5000 finally runing

* put the contact and email in TSL traing website in contact page too

#####26/2/2016

* code for der failed because didn't save the changes (they were saved in another folder???????). Launched again with corrections.

* the simulation for DT5000 and DT10000 were hanging (running but doing nothing), so i killed them, the new list was not being passed to the saving function.
  Launched again with correction and also for the other DT.

#####29/2/2016

* the simulation for the events finished running over the weekend and the derivatives plots are now ready

* wrote a script to make an heatmap with the events
  tried differents things:
  * first 100 events after the first jump for all the cases
  * first 100 events after first jump for c=0.6 diffrent DT
  * first 100 events after first jump for DT=5000 different c values
  Then plotted 50 events before and after jumps 2,3,4. Again for the previous cases considered.
  Will be used all cases with jumps.
  Tried different colormaps, added labels (for the heatmap is needed a numpy array, i used <code>imshow()</code> with <code>interpolation="none" or "nearest"</code>. discretized colorbar and changed proportion of the figure to make it be squarish and not very long and short.
  There is not a very clear pattern, and i do think it's nice, but you can see that the situation is actually changing after a jump.
  Also these are the events:
  > effectors: 0-hgt, 1 mutation, 2-duplication, 3-silencing 4-del
  > tes: 5- hgt, 6-duplication, 7-deletion
