* finishing HTML tutorial

* reading:
  >_Review. Random walk models in biology_  
  > E. A. Codling _et al._

* fixed images in the **new** folder w/ c 4 the paper: changed the dimesion of the zoom insert in **randomwalk.png**, make it black and with dots instead of circles, commented the style so that all the plots are as plain as possible. Changed the axis format to be scientific and without repetitions ('%2.1e' means 2 digits before the dot and one after), corrected a typo in legend. Zip all the folder. These are going to be used as references for the model, because they represent the "standard" behaviour.

* downloaded and installed components (node.js and others) for tomorrow workshop, looking at the basic documentation

  > Goodwin _et al._  
  > [...]The advantages of this approach include potentially very long and unbiased sequence reads, because neither amplification nor chemical reactions are necessary for sequencing[...]  
  > This device, the MinION, is a nanopore-based device in which pores are embedded in a membrane placed over an electrical detection grid. As DNA molecules pass through the pores, they create measureable alterations in the ionic current. The fluctuations are sequence dependent and thus can be used by a base-calling algorithm to infer the sequence of nucleotides in each molecule[...]both strands are sequenced, a consensus sequence of the molecule can be produced; these consensus reads are termed “2D reads” and have generally higher accuracy than reads from only a single pass of the molecule (“1D reads”).[...]
  > However, both the “1D” and “2D” read types currently have a high error rate that limits their direct application [...] and necessitates a new suite of algorithms.  
  > _after alignment w/ different sofware just a minority of 1D reads aligned, and just a little more than half of the 2D reads_  
  > [...] fragments longer than 80 kb are virtually unalignable.[...]  
  > For longer reads (>50 kb), only portions of the reads can be successfully aligned, which suggests that reads are composed of both high- and low-quality segments. However, this local variability in quality does not seem to be position specific, and on average the per-base error rate is consistent across the length of a read [...]  
  > Between 20% and 60% GC content, the coverage is essentially uniform,[...]  
  > To demonstrate the utility of the long reads, we attempted to assemble the yeast genome de novo using the Celera Assembler, which can assemble low-error-rate reads up to 500 kbp long. However, when raw nanopore reads were given to the assembler, not one single contig was assembled, and it became apparent that error correction was critical to the success of the assembly. Consequently, we developed a novel algorithm called Nanocorr to error correct the reads [...]  
  > Nanocorr uses a hybrid strategy for error correction, using high-quality MiSeq short reads to error correct the long but highly erroneous nanopore reads. It follows the design of hybrid error correction pipelines for PacBio long-read sequencing [...] although in our testing none of the available algorithms were capable of utilizing the nanopore reads [...] Nanocorr begins by aligning the short MiSeq reads to the long nanopore reads using the BLAST sequence aligner [...] Nanocorr uses a dynamic programming algorithm based on the longest-increasing-subsequence (LIS) problem to select the optimal set of short read alignments that span each long read [...] The error-corrected long reads can be used for any purpose, especially de novo genome assembly [...] the N50 contig length for the Oxford Nanopore-based assembly is 678 kbp compared to ∼60 kbp for the Illumina assembly [...]  
  > We then assembled those reads with the Celera Assembler, which follows an overlap-layout-consensus approach without decomposing the long reads into k-mers as is used in de Bruijn graph assemblers. [...] Upon alignment to the reference sequence, we found that >99% of the reference genome aligned to our assembly and the per-base accuracy of our assembly was >99.78%. [...]  We find that the best result was achieved by using the data from just the top three flow cells, representing ∼30× raw coverage of the genome [...]  
  > The results of this study indicate that the Oxford Nanopore sequence data currently have substantial errors (∼5% to 40% error) and a high proportion of reads that completely fail to align (∼50%). This is likely due to the challenges of the signal processing the ionic current measurements [...] as well as the challenges inherent in any type of single-molecule sequencing [...] ionic signal measurements are not of individual nucleotides but of ∼5 nt at a time. Consequently, the base calling must individually recognize at least 45 = 1024 possible states of ionic current for each possible 5-mer. We also observed the potential for some bias in the signal processing and base caller, particularly for homopolymers. [...]

* going through C++ tutorial. This is very interesting:
  ```c++  
a>b ? a : b      // evaluates to whichever is greater, a or b. 
  ```
