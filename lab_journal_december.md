* finishing HTML tutorial

* reading:
  >_Review. Random walk models in biology_  
  > E. A. Codling _et al._

* fixed images in the **new** folder w/ c 4 the paper: changed the dimesion of the zoom insert in **randomwalk.png**, make it black and with dots instead of circles, commented the style so that all the plots are as plain as possible. Changed the axis format to be scientific and without repetitions ('%2.1e' means 2 digits before the dot and one after), corrected a typo in legend. Zip all the folder. These are going to be used as references for the model, because they represent the "standard" behaviour.
